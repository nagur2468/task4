<h2><u>what is element in html..?</u></h2>
<ul type="square">

        structure and functionality. Elements are the basic building blocks of a webpage and 
        can represent different types of content, such as text, links, images, or headings.</li><br>
    <li>In this example is a starting tag, is an ending tag and it contains 
        some content between the tags, which form an element</li><br>
    <li>HTML Elements occur when one element is placed inside another, 
        creating a hierarchical structure. This structure is crucial for organizing content
         on web pages effectively, ensuring that different elements relate logically and visually to each other</li><br>
    <li>However, this can cause issues when you add additional HTML elements later on.
         Therefore, it is best practice to always include the closing tag for non-void HTML elements.</li><br>
